Nothing crazy, just goofing off.
Not finished if you were thinking about running anything.

              ///  History  ///

[2/26/23] Initial upload, unfinished, doesn't run

[2/27/23] Added functions, fixed issues. Works but buggy.

[2/28/23] Added a bunch of stuff. Pretty much entirely functional, aside from
          a few critical errors here and there. Beginning work on data validation
          and bugs.
